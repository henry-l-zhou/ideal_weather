1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ideal_weather.git
   cd ideal_weather
   ```


2. Add a `.env` file to the root of your project with the following structure:
   ```
   API_KEY=your-weather-api-key
   PORT=your-server-port
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/main.go 
   ```

## Usage
